## Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Produce exhaustive codebase analysis and Vedic-accuracy review in `FINDINGS.md`.
- Identify math issues, code bugs, and performance bottlenecks with improvements.

## Constraints/Assumptions:
- No builds or test runs; verify by inspection only.
- Findings must prioritize production-grade, precise Vedic astrology accuracy.
- Avoid adding TODOs or low-quality suggestions in code changes (none planned).

## Key Decisions:
- Limit scope to analysis and documentation; no code edits unless requested.

## State:
- Done:
  - Reviewed core ephemeris, varga, dasha, panchanga, and aspect logic.
  - Wrote findings report to `FINDINGS.md`.
- Now:
  - Awaiting feedback or requests for remediation.
- Next:
  - Implement fixes if user requests changes.

## Open Questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- None.

## Working Set (files/ids/commands):
- `FINDINGS.md`
- `CONTINUITY.md`
